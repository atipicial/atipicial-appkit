# Examples

This directory contains runnable examples.

## Front door / golden path

- Canonical (golden path) example: `vite-react-atipicial/` (Vite + React + TS + Atipicial)

Optional (later):
- `vite-react-atipicialx/`
- `vite-react-stellar/`

## Conventions

- Package manager: **`pnpm`** (canonical for examples and validation).
- Examples are intentionally standalone; no `pnpm-workspace.yaml` is required for this directory.

## Links (keep this tight)

- Validation ledger: `examples/VALIDATION_LOG.md`
- Test plan: `tests/TESTPLAN__appkit-adapters.md`
- Local smoke script: `tests/ci-samples/local-smoke.sh`

> Note on `node_modules/`
>
> `examples/vite-react-atipicial/node_modules/` may appear from local runs. It is not part of the AKB contract and should normally be ignored in reviews/PR diffs. The canonical behavior is defined by:
> - `examples/vite-react-atipicial/README.md`
> - `examples/VALIDATION_LOG.md`
> - `tests/TESTPLAN__appkit-adapters.md`

Run–break–fix cycle (chronological ledger; keep notes in `VALIDATION_LOG.md`):
1) create project
2) install deps (`pnpm install`)
3) run dev server (`pnpm dev`)
4) confirm connect flow opens
5) confirm provider exists after connection

## Tests & CI

For the canonical `vite-react-atipicial` example:

- Local smoke test: `tests/ci-samples/local-smoke.sh`
- Test plan and tiers: `tests/TESTPLAN__appkit-adapters.md`
- Sample GitHub Actions workflow: `tests/ci-samples/GHA__vite-react-atipicial.yml`
